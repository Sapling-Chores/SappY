## What is it?

SappY is a desk robot which uses Esp32 and oled to show animations(i.e. Facial expression). And reacts using multiple sensors. It also has sounds that makes it more lively.

## Features: 

* It uses esp32-S3 to control sensors and oleds.
* It uses MPU 6050 to detect shakkes and motions and react accordingly usig Oled and Sound ( sound- not added yet) .
* It has a BME 680 to measure air quality of the room the robot is in.
* It uses 3.7 V LiPo battery with a charging module Adafruit Power Boost 1000c
  
### Future features:
* I will be connecting it to a website or an app that will control its features and would let you add/delete more animations and audio files.
* The website would also fetch data from aqicn.org to give the measure of the Aqi of the city user has set on in the website.

## Why I made this project?

I study all day on my pc sitting on my desk, so I wanted something that would push my limits and also give me a bit of company. 
Also since I live in city with AQI level more than 130, I am always concerned about AQI of my room and my surrounding, So I made this project that I would not have to go and check AQI everytime on my phone/pc.
